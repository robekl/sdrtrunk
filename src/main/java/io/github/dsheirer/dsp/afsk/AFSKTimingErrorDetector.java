/**
 * Zero crossing error detector.  Provides symbol timing error correction values by detecting zero-crossings within
 * each symbol period.  Ideally there should be only 0 or 1 zero crossings within each symbol period.  However, when
 * there is a slight DC offset in the demodulated samples, there can be up to 2 zero crossings within a symbol
 * period.
 *
 * This detector will only provide error corrections when there are 1 or 2 zero crossings detected.  If the number
 * of zero crossings is greater than 2, then it is assumed that there is no signal present and the returned timing
 * error value is zero.  This detector provides an error correction value relative to (approximately) the middle of
 * a symbol period and therefore continuously attempts to align zero crossings to the middle of the period.
 *
 * Since this detector does NOT use interpolation, the error signal will contain minor levels of symbol timing
 * jitter.  Error signal values are reported as integrals of the sampling period.
